## Features

### 📊 Analysis Engine
- BPM detection via onset-based autocorrelation (analyzes first 60s for speed)
- Musical key detection using chroma-based Krumhansl–Schmuckler algorithm with Camelot and Open Key notation
- Energy level scoring (1–10) from full-track RMS via chunked reads
- Audio metadata extraction (format, bitrate, sample rate, duration, file size)
- Batch analysis with background thread pool and JSON cache (skips already-analyzed tracks)

### 🔍 Track Similarity
- Find the 25 most similar tracks in your library to any loaded track
- 32-dimensional feature vectors: 20 MFCC coefficients (timbre/texture) + 12 chroma means (pitch class)
- Cosine similarity scoring — loudness-independent, shown as 0–100% match
- Results in a dedicated Similar tab with BPM, key, and score; double-click to load

### 🌊 Waveform & Visualization
- Frequency-colored filled waveform: **red** = bass (0–200 Hz), **amber** = mids (200–4000 Hz), **cyan** = highs (4000+ Hz)
- **Overview panel** (40px) — full-track minimap, click anywhere to seek
- **Main panel** (120px) — auto-zooms to a ±15s window around the playhead for beat-level precision
- Beat and bar grid overlay synced to detected BPM
- Hot cue tick marks and loop region overlay rendered on both panels
- Click or drag-to-seek (seeks on mouse release, no audio artifacts)

### 🎛️ DJ Controls
- **6 color-coded hot cues** with persistence across sessions (keys `1`–`6`, `Shift+1–6` to clear)
- **Seamless A–B looping** — loop region decoded into RAM and played via `pygame.Sound(loops=-1)`, eliminating the pop/gap found in timer-based approaches
- **Bar-snap loop presets**: ½, 1, 2, 4, 8 bars from nearest beat
- Loop in/out controls (`I` / `O` keys) with live overlay on both waveform panels
- Volume slider, play/pause, and keyboard-driven seeking

### 📚 Library & Playlists
- Load individual tracks or entire folders (recursive scan); **multi-file select** supported
- Sortable columns: track name, BPM, key (Camelot order), energy level
- Low-bitrate flag on tracks below 320 kbps
- Search/filter across library
- Create, delete, and export playlists (copy tracks to folder)
- Multi-select drag-and-drop from library to playlist
- Multi-delete from playlist; sort playlist by BPM or key

### ⬇️ Downloads (Phase 2)

#### YouTube
- Paste any YouTube video or playlist URL into the **Queue** tab
- Downloads as **MP3 320 kbps** when ffmpeg is detected (auto-detected in common install paths); falls back to native m4a if ffmpeg is unavailable
- Per-row progress indicator with format badge; **Import** button appears on completion
- **⏹ Stop** cancels all active and pending queue items at once
- Per-row **✕** button and **✕ Remove Selected** to clear finished or unwanted entries
- Bulk **Import Selected** adds finished tracks to the library and auto-triggers analysis

#### Playlist Subscriptions
Subscribe to YouTube playlists or Apple Music playlists. On every app launch, TrackFlow checks for new additions and queues them automatically.

| Source | How it works |
|---|---|
| **YouTube Playlist** | yt-dlp `extract_flat` fetches the playlist index; new video IDs are downloaded directly |
| **Apple Music URL** | Paste any public `music.apple.com` playlist URL — TrackFlow extracts the anonymous JWT developer token from Apple's web-player JS bundle and calls the Apple Music catalog API to list tracks |
| **iTunes XML** | Parses the `iTunes Music Library.xml` written by Apple Music for Windows (uses Python stdlib `plistlib`) — works for private/personal playlists not accessible via URL |
| **Shazam** | Shazam syncs to Apple Music — enable the Apple Music integration and add the "Shazam Library" playlist via iTunes XML |

For Apple Music and Shazam tracks, TrackFlow searches YouTube using three query variants (`Artist - Title`, `Title Artist`, `Artist Title official audio`) and downloads the best match. Tracks not found on YouTube are shown in a **Not Found** table for manual retry.

Sync state is persisted in `data/sync_state.json` — already-downloaded tracks are never re-queued. Use **🗑 Clear Cache** next to any subscription to reset its sync history (useful when testing or re-downloading a playlist).

#### SoulSeek Watcher
- Point TrackFlow at your SoulSeek "completed downloads" folder
- `watchdog` monitors the folder in real time (catches both new file creation and SoulSeek's `.tmp` → final filename rename-on-completion)
- Each detected audio file appears in the watcher table with an **Import** button

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Conda (recommended) or pip
- **ffmpeg** (optional) — required for MP3 320 kbps output. TrackFlow auto-detects it from your PATH and common install locations; without it, downloads fall back to m4a.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ashaydave/TrackFlow.git
cd TrackFlow

# Create conda environment
conda create -n dj-analyzer python=3.11 -y
conda activate dj-analyzer

# Install dependencies
pip install PyQt6 numpy scipy soundfile soxr mutagen pygame yt-dlp watchdog
```

### Run

```bash
python main.py
```

### Build Executable (Windows)

```bash
build.bat
# Output: dist\TrackFlow\TrackFlow.exe
```

Requires PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`) and the conda environment above. See `build.bat` for details.

## Using the Downloads Tab

### YouTube — single track or playlist

1. Click the **⬇ Downloads** tab at the top of the window
2. Set your **Save to** folder (your DJ library folder, or a staging area)
3. Paste a YouTube URL (video or playlist) into the URL bar and click **+ Add**
4. Click **▶ Download All** — progress updates per row; the format badge shows `MP3` or `M4A`
5. When a row shows **✓ Done**, click **⬆ Import** to add it to the library and trigger analysis
6. Use **⏹ Stop** to cancel all downloads at once, or **✕** on individual rows to remove them

### Playlist Subscriptions

1. Go to **⬇ Downloads → Subscriptions**
2. **YouTube:** click **+ Add YouTube Playlist**, paste the playlist URL, give it a label
3. **Apple Music (URL):**
   - Paste a public `music.apple.com` playlist URL into the **Apple Music URL** field and click **+ Subscribe**
   - TrackFlow automatically fetches the track list from the Apple Music catalog API
4. **Apple Music (iTunes XML / Shazam):**
   - Click **Detect** to auto-find your `iTunes Music Library.xml`, or browse manually
   - Click **+ Add Playlist** and type the playlist name exactly as it appears in Apple Music (e.g. `Shazam Library`)
5. Click **🔄 Sync Now** to run a manual check, or simply relaunch the app — sync runs automatically 2 seconds after startup
6. Use **🗑 Clear Cache** next to a subscription to re-sync all tracks (bypasses the already-seen filter)
7. New tracks appear in the Queue tab; click **Import Selected** to bring them into the library

### SoulSeek Watcher

1. Go to **⬇ Downloads → SoulSeek Watcher**
2. Click **Browse** and navigate to your SoulSeek "Finished Downloads" folder
3. Click **▶ Start Watching** — the status indicator turns green
4. As SoulSeek completes downloads, files appear in the table automatically
5. Click **⬆ Import** on any row (or **Import All New**) to add files to the library
